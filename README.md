# Shop-Management-System
Shop Management System - My First Semester Project
This GitHub repository contains the source code for a console-based shop management system, developed as a project for the first semester. The project is implemented in C++ and includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing products using file handling.

Features
The shop management system offers the following features:
1.	Add Product: Allows the user to add a new product to the system. The user can enter the product name, price, and quantity, which are then stored in a text file.
2.	Display Products: Retrieves and displays all the products currently stored in the system. The product information includes the name, price, and quantity.
3.	Update Product: Enables the user to update the price and quantity of an existing product. The user is prompted to enter the name of the product to be updated, and if found, the corresponding fields are modified in the text file.
4.	Delete Product: Provides the option to delete a product from the system. The user is prompted to enter the name of the product to be deleted, and if found, it is removed from the text file.

Usage
1.	Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/imshaheer/Shop-Management-System.git
2.	Compile the source code using a C++ compiler of your choice.
3.	Run the compiled executable to launch the shop management system.
4.	Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various operations such as adding, displaying, updating, or deleting products.

File Structure
The repository contains the following files:
shop_management_system.cpp: The main source code file containing the implementation of the shop management system.
products.txt: The text file used to store the product information. Each line represents a product and includes the name, price, and quantity separated by spaces.
